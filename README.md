Vetrommeling
============

Crowdsourcing connector

A crowdsourcing application built for the Amsterdam Museum on behalf of [ab-c media](http://www.ab-c.nl/) and [Beeld & Geluid](http://beeldengeluid.nl/) by [@epoz](http://epoz.org/)

The application allows the museum staff to create crowdsourcing applications within the [PyBossa](http://pybossa.com/) application by searching for content in their [Adlib](http://www.adlibsoft.nl/) museum management system. The questions asked of users, are managed within the admin interface as provided by the [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Where does the name come from?

It is an old Dutch proverb - ["In de rommelingh is't vet "](http://books.google.nl/books?id=n8ZbAAAAQAAJ&lpg=RA2-PA202&ots=gzJaVVnEpQ&dq=rommelingh%20vet&hl=nl&pg=RA2-PA202#v=onepage&q=rommelingh%20vet&f=false) which relates to the proverb *Qui eget, in turba versetur* The needy man should keep with the crowd.
